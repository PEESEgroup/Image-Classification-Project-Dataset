# LC Image  Dataset for ChemE/SysEn 6880 Project
This dataset include two different sets of images: Class A and Class B. These images represent the optical responses of proteins interfaced with liquid crystal. Two type of proteins are placed on liquid crystals interfaces to trigger different responses. The dataset given here is used to discriminate between the reponses and analyze them.

## Description
In this project, your goal is to correctly classify images from the dataset. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works for the dataset and how different machine learning techniques compare.

### Dataset

**Train** (use for training and validation)
- A: 962
- B: 628
 
**Test** (use for testing)
- A: 104
- B: 105

### Skills 
-	Computer vision including convolutional neural networks
-	Classification and Clustering methods such as SVM, KNN, and T-SNE

### Goal
You should develop a model that correctly provide the correct label for each image in the test set.

### Evaluation and Perfromance 
This project is evaluated on the accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you correctly label). The perfromance attained on the test set should be at least 99.0%.
